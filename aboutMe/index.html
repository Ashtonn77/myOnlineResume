        <div class="container-item grid-body">
          I am a student with an artistic attention to detail and a strong,
          unwavering work ethic. My dedication to the improvement and growth,
          both of myself and and the field of computers, is unquestionable. I am
          loyal, imaginative, and at times, peculiar...traits that are, without
          a doubt, communicated through my work, and the bonds I form with my
          fellow colleagues and friends. If given the opportunity, I can almost
          guarantee that I will fast become an integral member of the team. I
          bring with me a wide wingspan of personal projects and campus
          commisions, together with a large array of extracurricular work that I
          fostered in my spare time.
          <br />
          Today, I am always striving to be better than I was yesterday and my
          only hopes for tomorrow is that it welcomes me. Like everyone else,
          all I want, all I've ever wanted, is to find my my place in the world.
          It's been a life long search and I've narrowed it down to the
          ever-growing, all-encompassing, field of computers. All I ask now, is
          that you give me a chance, a seat at the table as it were, so that I
          may finally be part of something great and do what I love to
          do...DESIGN, BUILD, DEPLOY.
